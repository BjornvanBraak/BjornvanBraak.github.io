Testing for Site
update dont understand why different pages have different resolution    
I am at a loss for words and dont know what is wrong. I have not learned different pages but I am very frustrated   
fixed it I was zoomed in on one page, wtf I did not know google remembers that.

cant quite get the javascript to work dont know what is wrong
started to look into the chrome dev sources but then lost interest.

javascript file is not showing up in the browser when referencing. It migth be because

got the javascript to work semi, but fear that it is loading before it has access to the html classes. I dont understand since the html needed is before.
Maybe it has to do with the fact that the php is on the server side and therefore loads after the js. Since js is client-side.
But why is then the css added correctly.

setting a timeout to load it on the stack doesnt work. I think I have to give up for now and just learn js further before I mess around more.
