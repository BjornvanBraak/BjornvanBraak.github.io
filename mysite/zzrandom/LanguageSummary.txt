Overview of Jargon and General description

HTML - hypertext markup language
The basic structure of the web page. It is used to format the text.
<p class="" id="">Text</p>
Id and class can be used together and seperate. However id have higher presendence.
So if the class has the color set to red but the id says blue. It will be blue.
However if it the color was inhereted from its parent element then it does not matter what attribute it was inherited from.
<p class="redInCSS" id="blueInCSS">
    <p class="grayInCSS"></p>
</p>
The names of the attribute are there to indicate that the actually name does nothing on its own. However if referenced to
it can be used to change the properties of the method. In the example above the property color of the p class embedded is in this case
equal to the class grayInCSS which is a descriptive name and does not mean that the color is of the embedded p element is per definition
the same as the description suggest.
Although the color or format can be set in the HTML code it is not good practice.
The reason CSS is there is to seperate styling from formatting. So if you see that the color is not what it supposed to be you now
where to look. This becomes increasingly important for debugging for increasing complexity of the site.
<p style="color: red;">I'm red</p>
This should never be used however. This has to do with the dynamic coding. U might imaging redesigning the view of your site. This
would be very error prone and tedious if all styles are embedded in the html code itself instead of being inserted by the computer code.
Since computer are famous for being able to handle repetitive task very well.

In the examples above the following jargon can be identivied
<# ...="v" ...="v"></#>
<#> - starting tag
</#> - closing tag - most element require a closing tag some however dont (e.g. link, image)
# - tagname - which indicates what the element is used for (p, image, video, h1, h2 etc)
... - attribute name - there a some universal attributes (eg. class and id) and some tagname specific (e.g. href)
v - value of attribute - sets the attribute to the value specified inside ""

CSS - cascading style sheet
Used to style the HTML
Previously hinted at the syntax for the CSS is the following
selector{property:v;}
selector - the element(s) the style is applied to - what do I want to style? (e.g. p,images,video)
property - the property of the element that is set - what part do I want to style? (e.g. color)
v - value you want to set the property of the element to

Javascript
Used to make the HTML dynamic
element.method.property

DOM - Document Object model
The DOM allows Javascript to access all parts of the HTML and therefore makes the HTML dynamic. All elements of HTML can be objects in
the DOM, objects are commonly reverted to as nodes. The DOM introduces a hierarchy, meaning that each element has a child and parent element.
The root element is the element who has no parent element.

HTML DOM


jQuery syntax
$(selector).action()
All jQuery methods are in writen inside of:
$(document).ready(function(){

});
This is because we want to load the jQuery only after loading everything else. Another way of doing this would be to insert the script at
the end of the body. However this is less than ideal. Therefore they call the root of the HTML or XML document object, which is document.
They use a method which has a descriptive name of ready which looks if the whole document is loaded.
//I dont understand if the action is the method or the whole thing is called the method. Because javascript calls object.method so I dont
//understand why they would then call it action in the first place.
jQuery is specifically designed to respond to events. The actions of visitor(user) that the site can respond thoug (e.g. clicking, 
hovering, pressing down on key) are called events. The response to an event is an eventhandler

After doing some research about creating your own board it seems overly complex and error prone. Since I do not have any previous javascript
experience I changed my mind and wanted the board and piece rules from another source and see if I can implement that in my website first.
