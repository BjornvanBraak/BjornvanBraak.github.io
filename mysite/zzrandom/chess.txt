jQuery is the most popular library for javascript which takes care of many common task.
This means you can focus on the core part of your code. Therefore I will adopt it into my code from a cdn for faster loading.
I might download it later if understanding via this way might be lacking and download the dev version not the compiled one.




Descissions

The first question is do I write my own graphical user interface (GUI) or do I download one.
I think I will at least try to write one since it is the most intiutive part of writing a chess enginge since we can see direct results easily.
The purpose is not to write best engine or coolest looking board, but simply to learn things. I choose chess since I play it occasionally.
Although being subpoor at it I enjoy it. Besides it has well supported community and documentation.
